<h1> What is the meaning of life ? </h1>

<h2>To pursue and attain happiness.</h2>

<h1> How dose one do this ? </h1>

To realize you should do only what is in your control and anything outside of that you shouldn't care about in mind, body and soul.

Live each day as thou it where your last. Be better, pursue excellence and become happy. 

Get rid of anything that stops you doing those, these could be thoughts, ideas, lack of practice. 

Embody this and soon you'll realize your happiness.
